# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

USAGE:
I Edited the HTML file to use semantic elements and got rid of all the Div's.

I Added alt tags to each of the image elements and made sure that every image was working properly.

I Verified that all links are working (including images) 

I Refactored the CSS file to be more concise.

I Edited the title element to something descriptive and concise. 

I Cleaned up and re-organized all the code.
